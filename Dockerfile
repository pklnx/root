# pklnx.space — static single-page landing site.
#
# The site is a single HTML file with inline CSS and no build step, so the image
# is nothing but nginx plus that file. Build and run:
#
#   docker build -t pklnx-space .
#   docker run --rm --read-only --tmpfs /tmp -p 8080:8080 pklnx-space
#
# The base image is deliberately unpinned: every rebuild picks up the current
# alpine image, so security patches arrive without anyone having to notice them.
# The price is that a new nginx minor can land unannounced — which is what the
# smoke test in .github/workflows/docker.yml is there to catch before the image
# reaches the registry. Pin to a minor (nginx:1.30-alpine) if a build ever has
# to be reproducible.
